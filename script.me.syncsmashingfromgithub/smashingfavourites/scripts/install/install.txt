use autoexec.py to continue with install?

Install addons
Need a list of what to install for each category below, including dependencies for non-repo stuff.

1
- Disabled versions of repo addons
Add these directly to folder and use enableaddons.py (or equivalent) to start them.

2
- My own addons
As above

3
- Standalone 3rd party addons
As above - check they don't need dependencies, in which case install those first?  Or not matter?

4
- 3rd party repos
As above

5
- Addons from kodi repo
Use xbmc.executebuiltin('InstallAddon(skin.amber)'), xbmc.sleep(1000), xbmc.executebuiltin('SendClick(11)') for each.
Need a loop to check if / when installed so can carry on?  Check this.

6
- Addons from libreelec repo
As above

7
- Addons from 3rd party repos
As above

Switch skin - maybe do this earlier?  Could switch to confluence immediately
restart
